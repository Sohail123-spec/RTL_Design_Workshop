# Final Assessment – Sequence Detector

The final assessment extends the laboratory RTL-to-GLS flow to a serial sequence detector. The implementation was designed, simulated, synthesized, technology mapped using the SKY130 standard-cell library, and verified again at gate level.

## Target Sequence

```text
1100000
```

The detector uses a finite-state-machine (FSM) to track the incoming serial data. When the complete target sequence is recognized, the registered output `detected` produces a detection pulse.

### Main Signals

| Signal | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `clk` | Clock input |
| `reset` | Synchronous reset |
| `din` | Serial input data |
| `detected` | Sequence detection output |
| `state` | Internal FSM state |

---

## 21. Sequence Detector RTL Design

The RTL implementation contains seven logical FSM states corresponding to the progress of matching the target sequence `1100000`.

```text
Start
  ↓
1
  ↓
11
  ↓
110
  ↓
1100
  ↓
11000
  ↓
110000
  ↓
1100000
  ↓
Detection
```

Three bits are sufficient to encode seven logical states because:

```text
2³ = 8
```

The input `din` affects the combinational next-state logic, while the registered `state` changes on the active clock edge.

---

## 22. RTL Simulation

The sequence detector was simulated using Icarus Verilog and the generated waveform was inspected using GTKWave.

![Sequence Detector RTL Waveform](screenshots/sequence_detector_rtl.png)

### RTL Result

The applied test sequence contains four occurrences of the target sequence.

```text
Expected detections = 4
Actual RTL detections = 4
Difference = 0
```

The first RTL detection is observed at approximately **350 ns** in the provided waveform.

---

## 23. Synthesis and SKY130 Technology Mapping

The verified RTL was synthesized using Yosys and technology mapped using:

```text
sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
```

### Final Mapped Statistics

```text
Number of cells: 22
```

| Cell | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| `sky130_fd_sc_hd__a21boi_0` | 1 |
| `sky130_fd_sc_hd__a21oi_1` | 1 |
| `sky130_fd_sc_hd__and2_0` | 5 |
| `sky130_fd_sc_hd__dfxtp_1` | 8 |
| `sky130_fd_sc_hd__nand2b_1` | 1 |
| `sky130_fd_sc_hd__nor2_1` | 5 |
| `sky130_fd_sc_hd__nor3_1` | 1 |
| **Total** | **22** |

Therefore:

```text
Sequential cells   = 8
Combinational cells = 14
Total mapped cells  = 22
```

### Yosys Statistics

![Sequence Detector Synthesis Statistics](screenshots/sequence_detector_stat.png)

### Technology-Mapped Schematic

![Sequence Detector Synthesized Schematic](screenshots/sequence_detector_synthesis.png)

A representative mapped state-storage cell observed in the synthesized netlist is:

```text
Instance : 58
Cell     : sky130_fd_sc_hd__dfxtp_1
Signal   : state[0]
```

---

## 24. Gate-Level Simulation (GLS)

The technology-mapped netlist was verified using the SKY130 Verilog standard-cell models together with the same testbench.

```text

          ↓
VCD
          ↓
GTKWave
```

The standard-cell model files used were:

```text
primitives.v
sky130_fd_sc_hd.v
```

### GLS Waveform

![Sequence Detector GLS Waveform](screenshots/sequence_detector_gls.png)

### GLS Result

The final GLS waveform shows four detection events.

```text
RTL detections = 4
GLS detections = 4
Functional difference = 0
```

The first GLS detection is observed at approximately **350 ns** in the provided waveform.

# Assessment Questions – Verified Answers

## Q10 – First RTL Detection

Approximately:

```text
350 ns
```

## Q11 – Number of Detection Pulses

```text
4
```

## Q12 – Predicted vs Actual Detections

```text
Predicted = 4
Actual    = 4
Difference = 0
```

## Q13 – Effect of `din`

`din` affects the combinational next-state logic. The registered FSM `state` changes only at the active clock edge.

## Q14 – Synthesis

The sequence detector was successfully synthesized using Yosys.

## Q15 – Sequential Cells

```text
8
```

## Q16 – Combinational Cells

```text
14
```

## Q17 – Total Mapped Cells

```text
22
```

## Q18 – Example Mapped State Cell

```text
Instance : 58
Cell     : sky130_fd_sc_hd__dfxtp_1
Signal   : state[0]
```

## Q19 – State Encoding

Seven logical FSM states can be represented with three bits because `2³ = 8`. The mapped implementation uses seven state-storage flip-flops plus the registered `detected` output.

## Q20 – Synthesis Statistics

```text
Total mapped cells = 22
Sequential cells   = 8
Combinational cells = 14
```

## Q21 – Post-Synthesis Schematic

The technology-mapped schematic is included above in the **Synthesis and SKY130 Technology Mapping** section.

## Q22 – First GLS Detection

Approximately:

```text
350 ns
```

## Q23 – RTL vs GLS

Both simulations produce four detection events:

```text
RTL = 4
GLS = 4
```

Therefore, the functional behavior is preserved after synthesis and technology mapping.

## Q24 – Timing Difference

RTL simulation represents the functional RTL behavior, whereas GLS represents the technology-mapped standard-cell implementation. Consequently, GLS can show gate-level propagation-delay effects that are not represented in an ideal RTL simulation.

## Q25 – Final Conclusion

The synthesized and technology-mapped sequence detector preserves the functional behavior verified at RTL. Both RTL and GLS produce four detection events for the applied testbench, confirming functional agreement.

# Conclusion

The VLSI Design and Synthesis laboratory provided practical exposure to the RTL-to-gate-level design and verification flow.

The work covered Verilog RTL coding, testbench-based simulation, GTKWave waveform analysis, Yosys synthesis, logic optimization, technology mapping, SKY130 standard-cell usage, gate-level netlist inspection, and gate-level verification.

The MUX experiments demonstrated the relationship between RTL coding and synthesized hardware, while the Good MUX and Bad MUX comparison highlighted the importance of correct RTL implementation.

The laboratory was further extended to hierarchical design and the VSD BabySoC environment, including RVMYTH inspection, testbench analysis, synthesis, synthesis statistics, netlist inspection, and pre-synthesis/post-synthesis comparison. The final assessment extended the same RTL-to-GLS flow to a sequence detector for the target sequence `1100000`, including RTL verification, SKY130 technology mapping, and gate-level verification.

Overall, the practical work demonstrated the progression:
